# pjs
lightweight javascript librairy, just for fun and learning

goals :
- non restrictive : may cohabit well with other javascript framework and vanilla js code
- modularity. It must be possible to create components that lives alone. (1 component 1 file)

Todos :
- two-way bindings for inputs
- Handle all object levels in spies (currently just first-level properties can be watched)
- events
- ...
- custom tags to load components (like <pjs-my-component>)
